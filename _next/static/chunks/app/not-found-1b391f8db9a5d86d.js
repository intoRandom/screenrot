However, any script that allows remote code execution (RCE) or the downloading and execution of external files can be dangerous if it comes from an untrusted source. That is why we always recommend verifying the source code and running it only from official sources to minimize risks."},{question:"Does the script modify anything on my computer?",answer:"This script does not make permanent changes to your computer; it only temporarily downloads an image and a sound and schedules a task that is automatically deleted after execution. However, an attacker could modify files or execute arbitrary commands that do alter the system."},{question:"Is this script detected as a virus by antivirus software?",answer:"No, this script is not detected as a virus by most antivirus software, which illustrates how certain remote code execution (RCE) attacks can go unnoticed and compromise a system without raising immediate alarms."},{question:"What is remote code execution (RCE)?",answer:"Remote code execution (RCE) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute commands or programs on a target system from elsewhere, without physical access. This can give the attacker full control over the device, risking the user's security and privacy."},{question:"What types of files are most commonly used for attacks?",answer:"Files most commonly used for attacks include executables (.exe), scripts (.bat, .cmd, .ps1), macro-enabled documents (.docm, .xlsm), and compressed files (.zip, .rar) that may contain malicious code designed to infect systems."},{question:"What risks are involved in opening files from unknown sources?",answer:"Opening files from unknown sources can expose your device to malware and viruses. These files may contain malicious code that executes automatically, compromising your information, system control, or network."},{question:"Why shouldn't you download pirated programs?",answer:"Pirated programs often contain malicious code that can enable cyber attacks or data theft. Additionally, they are illegal and can cause legal and security problems for the user."},{question:"What should I check before running a file?",answer:"Before running a file, you should verify its origin, ensure it comes from a trusted source, scan it with updated antivirus software, and check that the file extension matches its content."},{question:"Can I share this script with others?",answer:"Yes, you can share this script with others. Our goal is to encourage the spread of knowledge to build a strong cybersecurity culture, especially considering threats like remote code execution (RCE) can affect any user without proper precautions."}]}},direction:"ltr"}},languages:{es:{loader:()=>o.e(205).then(o.bind(o,7205))}},browser:!0,storage:!0,bgColor:"black",duration:100})},5212:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.d(t,{$:()=>c,r:()=>l});var a=o(6384),i=o(6636),r=o(8827),s=o(88),n=o(5515);let l=(0,s.F)("inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-base font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50",{variants:{variant:{default:"bg-primary text-background hover:bg-primary/70 font-bold",destructive:"bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90",outline:"border border-input border-2 bg-background hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",secondary:"bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",ghost:"hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",link:"text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline"},size:{default:"h-10 px-4 py-2",sm:"h-9 rounded-md px-3",lg:"h-11 rounded-md px-8",icon:"h-10 w-10"}},defaultVariants:{variant:"default",size:"default"}}),c=i.forwardRef((e,t)=>{let{className:o,variant:i,size:s,asChild:c=!1,...d}=e,u=c?r.DX:"button";return(0,a.jsx)(u,{className:(0,n.cn)(l({variant:i,size:s,className:o})),ref:t,...d})});c.displayName="Button"},5515:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.d(t,{cn:()=>r});var a=o(4534),i=o(6140);function r(){for(var e=arguments.length,t=Array(e),o=0;o<e;o++)t[o]=arguments[o];return(0,i.QP)((0,a.$)(t))}},5806:(e,t,o)=>{Promise.resolve().then(o.bind(o,2812))}},e=>{var t=t=>e(e.s=t);e.O(0,[867,884,309,951,358],()=>t(5806)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
